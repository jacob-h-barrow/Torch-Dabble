# Torchy Test

## Why Now?
- 8 months ago my deep learning computer underwent a cyber attack
- Finally, had the time to fix it and test the GPU on it again

## What To Expect
- PyTorch is cool, but AI is not my end goal
- Nice to learn here and there for my future K-12 Tech School

## Where To
- Hope to integrate this with my py_judger package for the students
- Have a couple of mining rigs in mind to learn: ex. collaborative blind studies

## End Goal
- Startup 2025 to raise money for my K-12 Tech School
- This code is crucial for learning DL in the classroom
